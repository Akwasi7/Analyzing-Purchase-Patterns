# Analyzing-Purchase-Patterns
This project explores customer credit behavior and risk signals using a simulated transaction dataset. It demonstrates my ability to build a relational database, write advanced SQL queries, and analyze financial behavior to generate actionable insights. This aligns with real-world skills used in commercial banking, credit risk, and data analysis roles.

#Tools & Technologies
- MySQL – Data modeling, querying, aggregation
- CSV Files – Raw transactional data inputs

 Key Skills Demonstrated
- Financial Data Analysis
- Customer Segmentation
- Risk Trend Identification
- SQL Query Development
- Data Cleaning and Transformation
- Business Communication through Insights

Sample Insights
- Identified customer segments with increasing credit utilization over time.
- Detected patterns of frequent late payments concentrated in a specific demographic group.
- Suggested strategic actions like targeted credit counseling or adjusted interest rates.

How to Run
- Import the SQL schema into a MySQL database.
- Load the transactions.csv data using MySQL’s LOAD DATA INFILE or a GUI like MySQL Workbench.
- Run the queries in queries.sql to extract behavior patterns.
